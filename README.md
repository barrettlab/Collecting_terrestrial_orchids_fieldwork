# General information for conducting (terrestrial orchid)  fieldwork

## Main travel

•	Set multiple alarms. Don’t miss your flight. Show up to PIT 2 hours early, or even earlier for big airports. Factor in time to park, drop rental car off, etc.

•	When packing, make a list of things you need to bring, and things you will need to pick up when you get there (Walmart is great for this).

•	Download the airline app (e.g. United) and sign up for eAlerts.

•	Don’t forget your driver’s license/ID.

•	If you don’t want to spend the trip with covid or some other nasty virus, wear a mask on the plane. If you have to sit in a hotel room for a week with covid, you will have wasted thousands of taxpayer $$$ and accomplished nothing.

•	Use your P-card for flights, rental car, hotels, gas, shipping plants back to WVU.

•	DO NOT use your Pcard for food or other stuff like that. You get per diem, which requires no receipts.

•	Keep all of your itemized receipts in one place, organized. You’ll need to submit these for any Pcard purchases.

## Accommodations

•	A good plan of action is to find a not too big place (i.e. not San Francisco or Seattle, but someplace like Ukiah, Eureka, etc.) as a home base, where you can get to your planned collecting sites easily (e.g. an hour or two’s drive). There will be more hotel/food/etc. options there without big city traffic. These places often have good breweries that have good beer, food, and music.

•	Stay in something like Motel 6. They are not fancy but they are consistent and cheap, have running water, and are generally safe. They run from $60-100 usually, and will not run our budget through the roof. Book these ahead of time if you have a solid idea of where you will be working. E.g. I stayed in the motel 6 in Sacramento when working in the nearby Sierras, but don’t stay in that one because it is super sketchy.

•	Bring ALL of your stuff into the hotel room. Don’t leave anything in the car.

•	Be aware that around weekends and holidays, everything might be booked, so plan ahead. Campsites, since the pandemic, will be crazy and booked, especially if you are near a big population center or national park.

•	If you are way out in the field, it is getting late, and you don’t want to drive anymore, sleep in the car (e.g. in a campsite, or just along a logging road with no traffic). Don’t trespass. Make sure you have a warm blanket/sleeping bag/pillow and clothing, food and water. It gets very cold in the mountains, even when it is 80F+ in the valleys and by the coast. Let the owls sing you to sleep.

•	When you check out, get an ITEMIZED receipt both hard copy and by email as a backup for submitting your Pcard reports. Keep these organized by day.

•	Get and keep all your gas receipts. Don’t forget these or you’ll regret it later. Keep these organized and labelled by day. 

## Finding the plants, travel during fieldwork

•	For Cephalanthera/Corallorhiza, you should have planned where you want to collect based on specimen records. iNaturalist records can be okay, but there are not often trustworthy and may be obscured localities (understandably so). 

•	In general, look in mature forests with big trees. Find the biggest trees, and you’ll likely have good luck. Avoid obvious monocultures of Doug Fir, which tend to have lower diversity, although sometimes these plants will surprise you.

•	Don’t be careless with a rental car or with your own safety.

•	Always have your permits, signed, with you.

•	A lot of the roads where you will find plants will be unpaved. DON’T take unnecessary risks. If a road looks sketchy, has warnings etc., make other plans. Have backup plans.

•	Make sure you are on Forest Service land (if that is what you permits allow) and not in a state or national park (or private land), or in a forest service wilderness area. Generally try to avoid people when collecting. They are nosy.

•	Download the offline google map for each place/region you will be. Have the DeLorme Gazetteers and other maps as backup. Don’t trust your phone’s GPS to tell you if a road is safe.

•	You can stop in at any USDA Forest Service Ranger station and get maps/information on local conditions. It might also be good to show the USDA staff your permit and tell them you’ll be doing some collecting in the area.

•	If you are on a non-paved road and things start to get sketchy, STOP, pull over so other vehicles can pass, and plan for how you will turn around and get out. You will encounter washouts, steep cliffs, unexpectedly locked gates, snow, ice, deep mud, sand, huge rocks, downed trees, floods, etc. Use your best judgement and do not put yourself in danger.

•	Keep the car locked when not in it, and don’t block the road. Don’t collect plants in plain view of the road, where people might get suspicious or nosy. AVOID PEOPLE.

•	Get a small/medium sized cooler, ice, beer, water, food for a few days. Make sure to drain the cooler and get ice each day or every 2 days. Keep the plants you collect in here but NOT directly on the ice (don’t freeze them).

•	Let someone know where you will be for the day, in general, in case something happens (i.e. send the grad students and me a text each morning before you go out to the field. E.g. “Hey guys, I’ll be in Trinity Natl Forest, South of Big Bar today.” This if for YOUR SAFETY.

## Collecting plants

•	Get a [field notebook](https://www.amazon.com/Elan-Publishing-Company-E64-8x4S-SewnField/dp/B07236546Y/ref=sr_1_23?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.DwUrWiXoUUV_ogNaCEWh1C17dDIK9K8EKsnk-inLU6SdQgfz0QXeDPSZj3K3XcFx7uX515UMqC5zx57WZm6ld6vWAcUfPAPYEv6z74BvOsuGGMerAzq0NmJ3E_GM754uAgArjYtZnrBkYjro6zQZWyXGzvpi96xn-bT5a2MhPKzzVBjYib-IHCRm8WjOSsQHXcxLDXpkROFE46VtTpQwBtGdmeBJs47o_0J5s2stvlqvjlKIIdvs1NKzMFwFx8FJWQoAFkIHX9XWnj-WKc-gRVHSwwKxrr5SVde758-Txmw.jT_jfB7IoQ-uTz-5RjWSxc86NAy8YGLjuTpBAtfV1VE&dib_tag=se&keywords=field%2Bnotebook&qid=1717440507&sr=8-23&th=1) and get or borrow a decent GPS unit (your phone will be unreliable) and keep meticulous notes. Include: collection number, date/time collected, specific locality information (how to get there), GPS coordinates including elevation, associated tree, shrub, and forb species, slope/aspect, soil characteristics (if known), and any notes about the plants themselves. See below. Any info (e.g. exact elevation) unknown can be filled in later.
 

•	Get a garden knife (hori hori style, I have [this one](https://www.amazon.com/PERWIN-Weeding-Planting-Stainless-Full-Tang/dp/B0BCK7NRBH/ref=asc_df_B0BCK7NRBH/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=693713553106&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=4992815240781587225&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=1028383&hvtargid=pla-1948805327442&psc=1&mcid=aebc6ab6638a397999f3e13291e476be&gad_source=1)). This will allow you to dig deeply and get roots/rhizome e.g. for Cephalanthera/Corallorhiza. I usually plunge it deeply around all four sides of the plant, and then excavate. Clear excess dirt and place all the plants collected in a large, 2gal ziplock. Label the bag with the collection # and date for processing later. Try not to disturb the sourrnounding area too much, and cover your digging tracks. Leave as pristine as possible.

•	If this is a new collection, save 1 plant for a voucher specimen. Clean, dry, and press the plant in a press between newspaper (labelled with collection #, species, and date), and blotting paper.

•	When you are done collecting, make your entry in your field notebook.

•	If you see any potential pollinators, make recordings, or try to capture one (e.g. with attached pollinia if possible when working with orchids).
Processing orchid samples: shoot and rhizome.

•	SUPPLIES NEEDED: Sealable ziplocks (~100 sandwich bags, ~100 1-gallon, and ~10-20 2-gallon). The latter can be used for temporary transport. Cheap vodka (for pickling flowers); rubber bands; sharpies (fine and ultra fine); screw cap tubes (5 or 15 ml), strips of parafilm (for sealing pickled flowers); forceps; scissors; pens/pencils; lab tape; flagging tape; plant press; an old toothbrush (for scrubbing roots/rhizomes); Dried silica gel (optional).

## Processing collected plants for shipping

•	In general, you should have enough material for DNA extraction from both shoot and root/rhizome material (at least a few flowers and ~2cm of root/rhizome tissue).

•	The 1-2 most basal flowers from the raceme, in good shape, should be pickled in vodka for morphometrics.

•	Carefully rinse all the dirt off of the plant shoots and blot dry with paper towels or a towel from the hotel room.

•	Scrub the rhizomes/roots under running cold water. Get every bit of soil/fine roots off. It may also be a good idea to save some soil for downstream analyses. Bring or buy a small mesh colander/sieve to keep dirt/rock/roots from clogging the sink. You don’t want to have to deal with that. Use one of the ice buckets to collect the water, strain it, and discard. It may help to break up e.g. coralloid rhizomes to remove all dirt. Pat them dry with a towel.

•	Save each individual (shoot and rhizome) in a single, labeled sandwich bag. Squeeze out all air and roll up the bag. 

•	With a rubber band, connect all bags from a single locality. Keep these in secondary bags (1 gallon). Keep everything labelled and organized.

•	If not using silica for drying plants, ship these fresh overnight back to WVU. Send an email or text to everyone to know when to expect them. Pay for this with your Pcard and keep all receipts! Don't ship pickled flowers in ethanol, keep these. The day before you travel back, dump the ethanol out of each tube and re-seal. When you get back, pickle these overnight in FAA, then switch out with 70% ethanol.
